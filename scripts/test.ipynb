Here are the datasets: [RealDictRow({'table_name': 'accidental drug related deaths 2012-2022', 'table_desc': 'A listing of each accidental death associated with drug overdose in Connecticut from 2012 to 2022. A \"Y\" value under the different substance columns indicates that particular substance was detected.\\n\\nData are derived from an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report, death certificate, as well as a scene investigation.\\n\\nThe “Morphine (Not Heroin)” values are related to the differences between how Morphine and Heroin are metabolized and therefor detected in the toxicity results. Heroin metabolizes to 6-MAM which then metabolizes to morphine.  6-MAM is unique to heroin, and has a short half-life (as does heroin itself).

If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as \"Unknown\". \\r\\n \\r\\nCases with a positive molecular (PCR) or antigen test are included in this dataset. Cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the “Cases - Weekly” column is not a reliable way to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among cases based on the week of death.\\r\\n \\r\\nFor tests, each test is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts include multiple tests for the same person (a change made on 10/29/2020). PCR and antigen tests reported to Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) through electronic lab reporting are included. Electronic lab reporting has taken time to onboard and testing availability has shifted over time, so these counts are likely an underestimate of community infection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe “Percent Tested Positive” columns are calculated by dividing the number of positive tests by the number of total tests . Because of the data limitations for the Tests columns, such as persons being tested multiple times as a requirement for employment, these percentages may vary in either direction from the actual disease prevalence in the ZIP Code. \\r\\n \\r\\nAll data are provisional and subject to change.

About half of all crash reports, mostly minor crashes, are self-reported at the police district by the driver(s) involved and the other half are recorded at the scene by the police officer responding to the crash. Many of the crash parameters, including street condition data, weather condition, and posted speed limits, are recorded by the reporting officer based on best available information at the time, but many of these may disagree with posted information or other assessments on road conditions. If any new or updated information on a crash is received, the reporting officer may amend the crash report at a later time. A traffic crash within the city limits for which CPD is not the responding police agency, typically crashes on interstate highways, freeway ramps, and on local roads along the City boundary, are excluded from this dataset.\\n\\nAll crashes are recorded as per the format specified in the Traffic Crash Report, SR1050, of the Illinois Department of Transportation. The crash data published on the Chicago data portal mostly follows the data elements in SR1050 form. The current version of the SR1050 instructions manual with detailed information on each data elements is available <a href=\"https://idot.illinois.gov/Assets/uploads/files/Transportation-System/Manuals-Guides-&-Handbooks/Safety/Illinois Traffic Crash Report SR 1050 Instruction Manual 2019.pdf\">here</a>.\\n\\nAs per Illinois statute, only crashes with a property damage value of $1,500 or more or involving bodily injury to any person(s) and that happen on a public roadway and that involve at least one moving vehicle, except bike dooring, are considered reportable crashes. However, CPD records every reported traffic crash event, regardless of the statute of limitations, and hence any formal Chicago crash dataset released by Illinois Department of Transportation may not include all the crashes listed here.\\n\\nChange 11/21/2023: We have removed the RD_NO (Chicago Police Department report number) for privacy reasons.', 'table_tags': ['link-to-article-present', 'public-safety', 'traffic-crashes', 'transportation', 'vision-zero'], 'previous_queries': ['Analyze the correlation between weather conditions and the number of crashes', 'Identify the most common primary cause of accidents', \"Understand if there's a certain time of the day or specific days in a week when accidents occur more frequently\", 'Evaluate the impact of traffic control devices on accident occurrence', 'Study the relationship between posted speed limits and crash severities', 'Investigate the types of injuries based on first crash types', 'Examine if there are more accidents in certain types of roadways', 'Assess if there are particular areas in the city with higher accident rates', 'Check if road defects contribute significantly to accidents', 'Trace patterns in the number of units involved in the crashes'], 'col_num': 48, 'example_records': [{'DAMAGE': 'OVER $1,500', 'LANE_CNT': '', 'LATITUDE': '', 'LOCATION': '', 'ALIGNMENT': 'STRAIGHT AND LEVEL', 'DOORING_I': '', 'LONGITUDE': '', 'NUM_UNITS': '2', 'STREET_NO': '5500', 'CRASH_DATE': '09/05/2023 07:05:00 PM', 'CRASH_HOUR': '19', 'CRASH_TYPE': 'INJURY AND / OR TOW DUE TO CRASH', 'CRASH_MONTH': '9', 'REPORT_TYPE': 'ON SCENE', 'ROAD_DEFECT': 'NO DEFECTS', 'STREET_NAME': 'WENTWORTH AVE', 'WORK_ZONE_I': '', 'HIT_AND_RUN_I': '', 'INJURIES_FATAL': '0', 'INJURIES_TOTAL': '3', 'PHOTOS_TAKEN_I': '', 'WORK_ZONE_TYPE': '', 'CRASH_RECORD_ID': '23a79931ef555d54118f64dc9be2cf2dbf59636ce253f7a1179c4a1c091442a6eeab8352220c7c56ca1ff7c4b4b0fc345c74e3e85ecb9d43deeb66b5f803d4a0', 'TRAFFICWAY_TYPE': 'FIVE POINT, OR MORE', 'CRASH_DATE_EST_I': '', 'DEVICE_CONDITION': 'FUNCTIONING PROPERLY', 'FIRST_CRASH_TYPE': 'ANGLE', 'INJURIES_UNKNOWN': '0', 'STREET_DIRECTION': 'S', 'CRASH_DAY_OF_WEEK': '3', 'WEATHER_CONDITION': 'CLEAR', 'WORKERS_PRESENT_I': '', 'BEAT_OF_OCCURRENCE': '225', 'LIGHTING_CONDITION': 'DUSK', 'MOST_SEVERE_INJURY': 'INCAPACITATING INJURY', 'NOT_RIGHT_OF_WAY_I': '', 'POSTED_SPEED_LIMIT': '30', 'STATEMENTS_TAKEN_I': '', 'DATE_POLICE_NOTIFIED': '09/05/2023 07:05:00 PM', 'ROADWAY_SURFACE_COND': 'DRY', 'INJURIES_NO_INDICATION': '2', 'INTERSECTION_RELATED_I': 'Y', 'SEC_CONTRIBUTORY_CAUSE': 'NOT APPLICABLE', 'TRAFFIC_CONTROL_DEVICE': 'TRAFFIC SIGNAL', 'INJURIES_INCAPACITATING': '1', 'PRIM_CONTRIBUTORY_CAUSE': 'UNABLE TO DETERMINE', 'INJURIES_NON_INCAPACITATING': '2', 'INJURIES_REPORTED_NOT_EVIDENT': '0'}, {'DAMAGE': 'OVER $1,500', 'LANE_CNT': '', 'LATITUDE': '', 'LOCATION': '', 'ALIGNMENT': 'STRAIGHT AND LEVEL', 'DOORING_I': '', 'LONGITUDE': '', 'NUM_UNITS': '2', 'STREET_NO': '7900', 'CRASH_DATE': '09/22/2023 06:45:00 PM', 'CRASH_HOUR': '18', 'CRASH_TYPE': 'NO INJURY / DRIVE AWAY', 'CRASH_MONTH': '9', 'REPORT_TYPE': 'ON SCENE', 'ROAD_DEFECT': 'NO DEFECTS', 'STREET_NAME': 'CHICAGO SKYWAY OB', 'WORK_ZONE_I': '', 'HIT_AND_RUN_I': '', 'INJURIES_FATAL': '0', 'INJURIES_TOTAL': '0', 'PHOTOS_TAKEN_I': '', 'WORK_ZONE_TYPE': '', 'CRASH_RECORD_ID': '2675c13fd0f474d730a5b780968b3cafc7c12d7adb661fa8a3093c0658d5a0d51b720fc9e031a1ddd83c761a8e2aa7283573557db246f4c9e956aaa58719cacf', 'TRAFFICWAY_TYPE': 'DIVIDED - W/MEDIAN BARRIER', 'CRASH_DATE_EST_I': '', 'DEVICE_CONDITION': 'NO CONTROLS', 'FIRST_CRASH_TYPE': 'REAR END', 'INJURIES_UNKNOWN': '0', 'STREET_DIRECTION': 'S', 'CRASH_DAY_OF_WEEK': '6', 'WEATHER_CONDITION': 'CLEAR', 'WORKERS_PRESENT_I': '', 'BEAT_OF_OCCURRENCE': '411', 'LIGHTING_CONDITION': 'DARKNESS, LIGHTED ROAD', 'MOST_SEVERE_INJURY': 'NO INDICATION OF INJURY', 'NOT_RIGHT_OF_WAY_I': '', 'POSTED_SPEED_LIMIT': '50', 'STATEMENTS_TAKEN_I': '', 'DATE_POLICE_NOTIFIED': '09/22/2023 06:50:00 PM', 'ROADWAY_SURFACE_COND': 'DRY', 'INJURIES_NO_INDICATION': '2', 'INTERSECTION_RELATED_I': '', 'SEC_CONTRIBUTORY_CAUSE': 'FOLLOWING TOO CLOSELY', 'TRAFFIC_CONTROL_DEVICE': 'NO CONTROLS', 'INJURIES_INCAPACITATING': '0', 'PRIM_CONTRIBUTORY_CAUSE': 'FOLLOWING TOO CLOSELY', 'INJURIES_NON_INCAPACITATING': '0', 'INJURIES_REPORTED_NOT_EVIDENT': '0'}], 'popularity': 7532, 'time_granu': ['hour', 'day', 'month'], 'geo_granu': ['city'], 'cosine_similarity': 0.022512702271342944}), RealDictRow({'table_name': 'covid-19 outcomes by vaccination status', 'table_desc': 'Weekly rates of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths among people living in Chicago by vaccination status and age. \\r\\n\\r\\nRates for fully vaccinated and unvaccinated begin the week ending April 3, 2021 when COVID-19 vaccines became widely available in Chicago.

Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department’s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable.', 'table_tags': ['big-apps', 'bigapps', 'collisions', 'nycopendata', 'nypd', 'traffic-data', 'vision', 'visionzero', 'zero'], 'previous_queries': ['data analysis tasks for motor vehicle collisions', 'machine learning tasks for traffic crash data', 'business intelligence tasks for NYPD traffic data', 'data analytics for traffic safety', 'analytics tasks for Vision Zero initiative data'], 'col_num': 29, 'example_records': [{'BOROUGH': '', 'LATITUDE': '', 'LOCATION': '', 'ZIP CODE': '', 'LONGITUDE': '', 'CRASH DATE': '09/11/2021', 'CRASH TIME': '2:39', 'COLLISION_ID': '4455765', 'ON STREET NAME': 'WHITESTONE EXPRESSWAY', 'OFF STREET NAME': '', 'CROSS STREET NAME': '20 AVENUE', 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 1': 'Sedan', 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 2': 'Sedan', 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 3': '', 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 4': '', 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 5': '', 'NUMBER OF CYCLIST KILLED': '0', 'NUMBER OF PERSONS KILLED': '0', 'NUMBER OF CYCLIST INJURED': '0', 'NUMBER OF MOTORIST KILLED': '0', 'NUMBER OF PERSONS INJURED': '2', 'NUMBER OF MOTORIST INJURED': '2', 'NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS KILLED': '0', 'CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 1': 'Aggressive Driving/Road Rage', 'CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 2': 'Unspecified', 'CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 3': '', 'CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 4': '', 'CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 5': '', 'NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS INJURED': '0'}, {'BOROUGH': '', 'LATITUDE': '', 'LOCATION': '', 'ZIP CODE': '', 'LONGITUDE': '', 'CRASH DATE': '03/26/2022', 'CRASH TIME': '11:45', 'COLLISION_ID': '4513547', 'ON STREET NAME': 'QUEENSBORO BRIDGE UPPER', 'OFF STREET NAME': '', 'CROSS STREET NAME': '', 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 1': 'Sedan', 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 2': '', 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 3': '', 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 4': '', 'VEHICLE TYPE CODE 5': '', 'NUMBER OF CYCLIST KILLED': '0', 'NUMBER OF PERSONS KILLED': '0', 'NUMBER OF CYCLIST INJURED': '0', 'NUMBER OF MOTORIST KILLED': '0', 'NUMBER OF PERSONS INJURED': '1', 'NUMBER OF MOTORIST INJURED': '1', 'NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS KILLED': '0', 'CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 1': 'Pavement Slippery', 'CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 2': '', 'CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 3': '', 'CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 4': '', 'CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 5': '', 'NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS INJURED': '0'}], 'popularity': 7439, 'time_granu': ['day', 'hour', 'minute'], 'geo_granu': ['state/province', 'city', 'zip code/postal code'], 'cosine_similarity': 0.01937263600556438}), RealDictRow({'table_name': 'water quality data', 'table_desc': 'Water quality data for the Refuge collected by volunteers collected once every two weeks: Turbidity, pH, Dissolved oxygen (DO), Salinity & Temperature.

The QCEW program produces a comprehensive tabulation of employment and wage information for workers covered by California Unemployment Insurance (UI) laws and Federal workers covered by the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe QCEW program serves as a near census of monthly employment and quarterly wage information by 6-digit industry codes from the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) at the national, state, and county levels. At the national level, the QCEW program publishes employment and wage data for nearly every NAICS industry. At the state and local area level, the QCEW program publishes employment and wage data down to the 6-digit NAICS industry level, if disclosure restrictions are met. In accordance with the BLS policy, data provided to the Bureau in confidence are used only for specified statistical purposes and are not published. The BLS withholds publication of Unemployment Insurance law-covered employment and wage data for any industry level when necessary to protect the identity of cooperating employers.\\r\\n\\r\\nData from the QCEW program serve as an important input to many BLS programs. The Current Employment Statistics and the Occupational Employment Statistics programs use the QCEW data as the benchmark source for employment. The UI administrative records collected under the QCEW program serve as a sampling frame for the BLS establishment surveys.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the data serve as an input to other federal and state programs. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the Department of Commerce uses the QCEW data as the base for developing the wage and salary component of personal income.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and California's EDD use the QCEW data to administer the Unemployment Insurance program. The QCEW data accurately reflect the extent of coverage of California’s UI laws and are used to measure UI revenues; national, state and local area employment; and total and UI taxable wage trends.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes new QCEW data in its County Employment and Wages news release on a quarterly basis.

With the updated methodology, the dollars shown on the Open Data site will continue to be inclusive of both types of overtime, but the OT hours will now reflect a singular block of time, which will result in a more representative total of employee OT hours worked.   The updated methodology will primarily impact the OT hours associated with City employees in uniformed civil service titles.  The updated methodology will be applied to the Open Data posting for Fiscal Year 2023 and cannot be applied to prior postings and, as a result, the reader of this data should not compare OT <b>hours</b>  prior to the 2023 report against OT hours published starting Fiscal Year 2023.
